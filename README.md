# LESSONS-Supervised-Learning
A repo for my Udacity lesson exercises on Supervised Learning.

## How To

### Clone this repository

``` bash
$ git clone git git@github.com:fab7/LESSONS-Supervised-Learning.git
$ cd LESSONS-Supervised-Learning
```

### Create and activate a Virtual Environemnt
It is a recommended best practice to always create a Virtual Environemnt. This will make this project easily reproducible and will isolate it from your system installed Python and other Python environments.
```bash
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install the required Python packages
#### Info/Warning: Make sure you are in your virtual environment!

```bash
(.venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start the Jupyter Notebook

```bash
(.venv)$ jupyter notebook
```
