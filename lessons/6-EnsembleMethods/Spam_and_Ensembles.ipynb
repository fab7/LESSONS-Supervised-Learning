    "\n",
    "* **Bootstrap the data** passed through a learner (bagging).\n",
    "* **Subset the features** used for a learner (combined with bagging signifies the two random components of random forests).\n",

    "### [INFO] Random Forest vsBagging\n",
    "Random Forest and Bagging are both ensemble learning methods that use multiple decision trees to make predictions. \n",
    "However, there are some key differences between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Number of features considered**: In Bagging, each decision tree is built using a random subset of the original features. This means that each tree only considers a subset of the available features. In contrast, Random Forest also uses a random subset of features for each tree, but it further restricts the number of features considered at each split. This helps to introduce more randomness and diversity among the trees.\n",
    "    \n",
    " - **Sample selection**: Bagging randomly selects samples from the original dataset with replacement to build each decision tree. This means that some samples may be selected multiple times, while others may not be selected at all. Random Forest, on the other hand, also selects samples randomly with replacement, but it additionally restricts the number of samples considered at each split. This further enhances the diversity among the trees.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Voting mechanism**: In Bagging, the final prediction is made by averaging or voting the predictions of all the individual decision trees. This means that each tree has an equal say in the final prediction. In Random Forest, the final prediction is made by majority voting. Each tree in the forest gets one vote, and the class with the most votes is selected as the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Random Forest introduces additional randomness and diversity among the decision trees by restricting the number of features and samples considered at each split. This helps to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model. "
